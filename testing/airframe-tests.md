# Airframe Tests

### Pressure Test

For the pressure tests, essentially what we want to do is examine how airframe components react when they are under high pressure. For this test, we are going to place an exploding device \(e.g. black powder or CO2\) inside a tube and airtight seal it between two bulkheads with a certain and fixed distance between them. For the first trial, the pressure examined will be relatively low and continuing on it will increase until the point of airframe components failure. The type of airframe components that fail first should be recorded and described after every trial.
