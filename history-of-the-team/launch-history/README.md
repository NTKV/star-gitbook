# Launch History

The goal of maintaining a launch history is to keep a chronology of lessons learned from each launch, as well as documenting successes, failures, and keeping a log of last-minute fixes \(which may need to get implemented into official checklists or may necessitate a change of design\).

The individual launch pages should contain photos, description of off-nominal procedures \(as well as the procedures followed during the launch, if possible\), notable events, as well as lessons learned for the relevant sub-teams.
