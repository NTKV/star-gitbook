**Public Sample Projects**

Sample projects on Sim Scale's Public Projects are one of the most useful ways to begin familiarizing with SimScale and the general mechanics of a computer simulation. Pay special attention to the mathematical models used and the different kinds of meshing algorithms. SimScale usually provides a brief explanation for the mathematical model or the meshing algorithm if you hover your mouse above it. The explanation usually includes remarks on what type of simulation the particular model or algorithm is suited for. If you encounter difficulties in setting up the initial mesh, a quick way to get around is to look for similar projects on SimScale's forum and reference their setups. Two links for CFD simulation will be provided below for  initial references.
