# Suppliers

## Stock Material

Check out the [Materials ](general-material-properties-and-uses.md)page if you're not sure what you want.

### Jacobs Hall

Jacobs sells at-cost and is often the best option available. Most commonly, plywood for laser cutting and 1/8" and 1/4" 6061 aluminum sheets are cheaper here than anywhere else.

### ePlastics

Would you like some Delrin? Lexan? ePlastics is pretty cheap and easy to order from on-line. Would recommend.

### TECO Technologies

If you need any **8020** extrusions or parts, this is the place to go. They give a 10% discount, but they sadly don't do sponsorships. They can also give 

some design advice and they can answer more specific questions about 8020 that can't be answered on the website \(you can also search the catalog\)! Michael and Benson have been in contact with David Morton from there. His email is david.morton@tecotechnology.com

Good customer service, highly recommend.

## Small Parts

### McMaster-Carr

Screws, bolts, washers, nuts, threaded rods, tooling, some stock, and similar are the most common purchases from McMaster. Many other parts \(gears, linear bearings, pumps, etc.\) are available but may be prohibitively expensive.

### Swagelok

If you need pipe fittings, valves, regulators, or really anything for propulsion, Swagelok is our go-to supplier.

## Electronics

### Digikey

Buy components from Digikey. Really everything should come from here.

### Mouser

If you can't find it on Digikey, maybe you can find it here?

### Arrow

Apparently Arrow is actually the largest supplier of these three by volume, so you should probably be able to find it here if not at the other two.
