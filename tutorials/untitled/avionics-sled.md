# Avionics Sled

## Purpose

The avionics sled fits into the avionics bay tube of the rocket. The sled must hold two altimeters and two 9V batteries. On the day of launch, altimeters need to be wired twice - first for ground test and then for the main flight. In order to be time-efficient, it is important that the altimeters can be easily accessed.

## AirBears

The AirBears avionics sled was the same as that used for Arktos. It fit into a 4" rocket and was used for the test launch on Nov 16, 2019. Overall, the design was effective as all components were housed and both parachutes successfully deployed. However, there was difficulty in wiring the altimeters due to their placement along the raised edges where the sled slides into the avionics bay.

## IREC 2020

The goals of the redesign of the avionics sled for the IREC 2020 rocket were the following:

1. Optimize the avionics bay for a 6" rocket
2. Address wiring concerns from AirBears to improve ease-of-use during launch

The new chosen design was an I-beam model, in which the batteries were placed in a center section of the sled and one altimeter was mounted to each side, as shown below. This design somewhat improved the space usage in the vertical direction, but there was significant unused horizontal space. The Recovery subteam selected this design because they felt it was more important to be able to wire the altimeters efficiently at launch than to use the least possible space.
