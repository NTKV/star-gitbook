# KiCad

## Installation

Download KiCad from here: [http://kicad-pcb.org/download/](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/)

This also contains instructions for each system.

## Schematic

#### Making schematic symbols

Use the following link to learn how to make new symbols for components when you can't find an existing symbol for it in the KiCad libraries.

Often, it can be worth finding an existing symbol that is similar \(for example, an older version of a sensor\), copying that into a new symbol in the calstar symbol lib, and then modifying it. Make sure to update the datasheet link and description!

## Layout

#### Making component footprints

If you've made your own schematic symbol for a component, you will almost certainly have to make a footprint for it as well. Footprints are described [here](https://calstar.gitbook.io/docs/tutorials/avionics/board-design#making-a-layout). The following link will show you how to make new component footprints.

As with schematic symbols, try finding an existing footprint and then modifying it according to the actual component's datasheet. Datasheets will have drawings and dimensions of the footprint, often under a section such as 'Packaging'.
