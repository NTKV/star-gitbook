# \[in progress\] Altimeters

Commercial off-shelf altimeters are often required and just nice to have for redundancy. We use the 2 perfectflite stratologger in the avionics bay for main and drogue parachute deployment.

## Programming

For the most part, the altimeters do not need to be programmed once bought. It can be reprogrammed for different modes including ignoring the first X seconds of flight. Refer to the manual linked at the bottom of this page but the reprogramming wires are purchased and housed in the Etcheverry locker.

## Wiring

Positive and negative does not matter for main and drogue as both sides go to an E-match. Same with switch, both sides are the same. However, make sure that the positive and negative sides of the battery is connected properly and listen to beeps for accuracy.
