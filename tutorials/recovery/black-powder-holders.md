# Black Powder Holders

**Test Launch** 

Recovery initially measured 2 grams to be used in the 2 black powder holders \(tubes with lids and a detonation wire\) with a scale, but proved to be too little to cause stage separation for the 4-inch rocket during the ground test. Subsequent ground test with the tube half full of black powder resulted in a successful ground test and stage separation during test launch. Further improvements will be made relating to the holders to secure them to the bulkhead instead of having them unrestrained during launch.
