# 9V Battery Holders

Used to secure the 9V batteries used to power the altimeters in the AV bay and the detonation of the black powder. The design is a hollow rectangular prism with an open side to allow insertion of the 9V battery. A near the face of the opening allows the battery to be secured inside the holder via ziptie as IREC does not allow adhesives for the launch.
