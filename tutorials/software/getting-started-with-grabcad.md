# Getting Started With GrabCAD Workbench

## 0. What is GrabCAD Workbench?

GrabCAD Workbench is an online platform to share CAD files and collaborate on projects, featuring version history tracking. It integrates directly with SolidWorks with a toolbar add-in and a desktop application.

## 1. Creating a GrabCAD Account

If you already have a GrabCAD account, you can skip this step.

{% hint style="info" %}
GrabCAD Community and GrabCAD Workbench accounts are the same
{% endhint %}

Creating a GrabCAD account is a straightforward process, first naviagte to:

{% embed url="https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/register" caption="Link to create a GrabCAD account" %}

In the company details section, choose job level as "Student" first before filling anything else out. The company name section should change to school name; type "University of California, Berkeley" \(or some variation thereof\) in the text box.

Proceed through the signup process.

Be sure to go to your email to confirm the account.

{% hint style="success" %}
You've now successfully created a GrabCAD account!
{% endhint %}

## 2. Getting added to CalSTAR on GrabCAD Workbench

CalSTAR parts do not currently have a set naming convention. **However, please follow common sense while naming CAD files; everyone should be able to have a good idea of what a file contains without having to open it.** A part named "Assembly.SLDASM", for example, might be better named as "RecoveryMainBulkhead.SLDASM". It is not necessary to include the project name for every file, and may not be necessary to include the subteam \("ThrustChamber.SLDPRT", for example, is unambiguous\). If you have questions, just ask in \#documentation!

**Message the email you used to sign up for GrabCAD to the Documentation Lead \(@rgovindjee\#4641\) along with a copy of the previous paragraph on naming to obtain an invitation to CalSTAR's GrabCAD page.** Let them know which projects you need access to, if possible.

## 3. Downloading the GrabCAD desktop application

The GrabCAD Workbench desktop application allows you to sync CAD files from your projects so that you have a local copy on your computer. It also installs the companion SolidWorks toolbar.

Navigate to the following link to download the installer:

{% embed url="https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/download" caption="GrabCAD Workbench desktop app installer" %}

Continue through the installation process. After completing the installation, be sure to log in with your GrabCAD account.

{% hint style="success" %}
You've now successfully installed the GrabCAD Workbench desktop application!
{% endhint %}
