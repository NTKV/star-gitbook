# OpenRocket Installation

## Installing OpenRocket Normally

#### Java

OpenRocket is an application that uses Java \(Version 6 or later\) to run. Mac OS generally comes with Java and will update it automatically. For Windows machines you may have downloaded Java for some other application already. To download the most recent version of Java, click [**here**](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

#### Downloading/Running OpenRocket

OpenRocket is free to download and is available [**here**](http://openrocket.info/). Once at the site, click to download the most recent version. The download should be fairly quick and you can run the file immediately once downloaded, so long as Java is installed.
