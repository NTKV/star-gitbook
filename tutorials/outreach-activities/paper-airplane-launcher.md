# Paper Airplane Launcher

A quick activity designed for Scientific Adventures for Girls. Elementary schoolers learn how to fold paper airplanes and various techniques to fold airplanes with different properties. The paper airplanes are modified with paper clips and hot glue to be compatible with the launchers. The launchers are laser cut from 1/4" plywood and 2 rubber bands tied in series.
