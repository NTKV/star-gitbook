Alka Seltzer Rockets are film canisters with 3D printed nose cones and fins, powered by Alka Seltzer tablets and water. Alka Seltzer is composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, and acetylsalicylic acid \(aspirin\), which react when dissolved in water, creating carbon dioxide gas. This activity is designed for booths at Discovery Days.

For optimal results, add 3/4 of an alka seltzer tablet broken up into 4-5 pieces and add enough water to fill up the canister about 1/4 of the way.
