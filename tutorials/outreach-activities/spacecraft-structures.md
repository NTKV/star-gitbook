# Spacecraft Structures

Spacecraft Structures involves designing an engine mount analogue that is tested using a lever and a dummy weight shaped like a rocket to mimic the forces of a rocket launch. The objective is to design and build a structure that can withstand 3 launches using minimal materials. The entire workshop takes around 2 hours and has been run at Splash, Expanding Your Horizons, and SWE High School Engineering Program.

The structure itself is composed of two 1/4" plywood plates with enough space in between to fit a film canister, which represents the rocket engine. Coffee stir sticks and hot glue are the only other materials provided to construct the rest of the structure.

The structures are tested by placing them in between the rocket and the lever and dropping a 15 lb \(6.8 kg\) weight on the other side of the lever from shoulder height.
