# HPR Design

## Kits vs. Custom Design:

* Kits are easier, and come with instructions
* Kits may also be cheaper
* If you design your own rocket, you will probably learn more -- but it does take more effort.
* Use [OpenRocket](http://openrocket.info/) to design and simulate your rocket!

## Where to Get Stuff

* Kits:
  * [MAC Performance Rocketry](https://macperformancerocketry.com/)
  * [Madcow Rocketry](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/)
* Parts:
  * [Bay Area Rocketry](http://bayarearocketry.com/)
    * Buy motors here.
    * They have L1 and L2 specials: a specific motor that they select, along with the motor casing.
      * Currently the [L1 special](http://bayarearocketry.com/product/bar-cert-l1/) is an Aerotech H128W motor.
      * Currently the [L2 special](http://bayarearocketry.com/product/bar-cert-l2/) is an Aerotech J350W motor.
    * We have a 38mm Aerotech casing!  \(RMS-38/240\)
  * [Apogee Components](https://www.apogeerockets.com/)
    * Like a Walmart of rocketry. They’ve got pretty much anything you need!
  * [Public Missiles Ltd.](https://publicmissiles.com/)
    * Their website sucks \(seriously, was it build in the 50’s?\).
    * Motor mounts, custom fiberglass fins, and more.
    * 10% Discount Code: Email them, they give universities a discount
  * [Fruity Chutes](https://fruitychutes.com/)
    * High quality parachutes \(will pack lighter and smaller\), but pricey.
    * 15% Discount Code: BERKELEY-WS-2017-15
  * [Giant Leap Rocketry](https://giantleaprocketry.com/)

## Articles to Read:

* TODO

## Design Check:

* Make sure you allocated enough space for your parachutes. Too much space is better than not enough space!
  * TODO: how to determine/estimate packing size
* Do you have rail buttons? \(Most likely you should have 1010 rail buttons\)
* Does your motor mount fit the motors you plan on using?
  * The motor can be longer than the motor mount, but then the motor may take up parachute space!
  * A lot of H motors are 38mm.
  * A lot of J motors are 54mm \(but the BAR L2 special \[the J350W\] is 38mm\).
* Ground hit speed should be &lt;20ft/s. Is your main parachute big enough?
* \(For dual deployment\) Speed at main deployment should be &lt;70-80ft/s. Is your drogue big enough? \(TODO: should I say &lt;50 ft/s instead?\)
* Velocity off the rail \(our rails are at least 8 ft\) should be &gt;50 ft/s.

## Design

* Stability = \(CG - CP\) / rocket diameter, with CG and CP measured from the bottom of the rocket. It is unitless, but usually written as a number of “cal”s.
  * Stability should be between 1.5 cal to 2.0 cal. Stability of 1.8 cal is good.
* Tubing:
  * Fiberglass is expensive \(?\).
  * Carbon fiber is more expensive \(?\).
  * Blue tube is strong and relatively cheap.
  * Don’t use cardboard for HPR.
* Shoulders:
  * Recommended shoulder length \(i.e. extent of coupler tube\) is about tube diameter \(i.e. 1 cal\).
* Nose cones:
  * 4:1 tangent ogive is nearly optimal. \(?\)
* Fins:
  * Plywood is good up to around 330 ft/s. Above this, there is significant risk of fin flutter, which can break your fins right off the rocket.
  * G-10 fiberglass has flutter speeds of over 1 Km/s \(~3330 ft/s\), so for L1/L2 it should be fine.
* Tube size:
  * Hands tend to be less than 4” across -- so if you want to be able to reach all the way inside your rocket, 4” should be big enough.
* Fin mounting:
  * Sandwich between bulkheads.
  * Epoxy the shit out of the fins.
* Bulkheads:
  * 0.25” plywood is a good choice.
* Motor mount:
  * Usually a phenolic tube.
  * Design around the length of the motor\(s\) you plan on using.
