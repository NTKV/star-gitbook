# SolidWorks file conventions

Conventions for CAD documentation of parts designed for use by STAR can be grouped into 2 categories: drawing setup and filename conventions.

Regarding drawing setup, CAD’s for the purpose of documentation should use the drawing template and use Imperial \(also known as IPS\) units. Furthermore sub-assemblies should be placed in external files \(a tutorial of how to do this is soon to come\).

Regarding filename conventions, filenames of CAD's should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Filenames should follow the general convention of: Project\_Subteam\_DescriptiveName\[\_McMaster part \#\]
2. Subteam should be denoted by its appropriate 3-letter abbreviation
   * AIR : Airframe
   * AVI : Avionics
   * PAY : Payload
   * REC : Recovery
   * PRO : Propulsion
   * SIM : Simulations
3. Project should be denoted by the selected abbreviation for the project
   * IREC20 : 6” diameter rocket design for IREC 2020
   * LE165 : “Hot Take”, Propulsion’s first-iteration of a liquid engine
