# Media

## **Task 1**

Help! STAR has an upcoming event and is in need of some unique flyers. This flyer should capture the club theme around rocketry and education. It should contain our basic information such as our name, logo, website link, and GoFundMe link. Aside from the requirements for the flyer, the rest is up to you and your creative spirit.

### **Marketing Portion:**

* Describe of the distribution of your flyers \(e.g. posted in Etcheverry, tabling on Sproul, etc\)

### **Media Portion:**

* Get comfortable navigating through Illustrator/Photoshop
* Become familiar with the design process

## **Task 2**

One of our missions is to get the STAR name out there. Ways to market our club to the public could include stickers, pins, and more.

1. Pick a marketing strategy -- stickers, pins, key chains, etc.
2. Design potential graphics, images, or other necessary files to accompany your product
