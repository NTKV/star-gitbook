# Airframe

## Intro Project - New Members

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_9630%20%281%29.jpg)

The new members will be tasked with designing an L1 rocket to show:

1. Basic knowledge of rocket design and component function
2. Commitment to learning new things
3. Work within a budget

The Airframe meetings at the start of the year - along with the GitBook - will contain all the information required to complete the project. In addition, I will hold office hours **Thursday 6-8pm** at Kresge or the CAEE, so please come and ask any questions you may have.

#### Constraints:

1. $400 budget \(including motor\)
2. Minimum 1,000 ft Apogee \(simulated at Snow Ranch conditions\)
3. **Project due 9/27**

#### Project **Deliverables**:

1. Report outlining design choices 

     a. Simulation data included

2. Line-item budget

     a. Should include supplier

3. OpenRocket model \([Guide on how to use OpenRocket](https://calstar.gitbook.io/docs/tutorials/airframe/airframe-openrocket)\)
4. SolidWorks CAD model
5. Procedures on how to assemble it
6. Powerpoint presentation outlining all of the above
7. Should be able to explain any question
8. Lastly, you must show up to one build day

**Given / Outside Scope of Project:**

1. Parachute sizes depending on mass and reasonable drift estimates
2. Specific separation procedures knowledge
3. Others as they come up will be added here

## Returning Members Project

The returning member project for Airframe will be the design of a 4 in. diameter rocket. Specs will be updated as decided by Systems.
