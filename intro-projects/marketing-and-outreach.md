# Outreach

**Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the existing outreach events and activities and marketing strategies and develop new ones. For new members, this will also be an opportunity to learn more about basic rocketry and the history of STAR.

**Projects must be presented to the whole subteam/business division. New members can choose 1 or more of these tasks.**  


**Option 1:**

**Designing, budgeting, and developing a lesson plan and activity related to aerospace suitable for elementary, middle, or high school level students.**

* The activity and lesson plan must span 10 minutes - 2 hours
  * The lesson plan can be in powerpoint form or a worksheet that outlines the scientific principles applicable to the activity and the steps to work through the activity.
* The materials must be easily procurable and safe for students and participants
* The logistics of the activity must be well planned and organized
* Find an event suitable for this activity \(ideally an event we did not go to last year\)

**Option 2:**

**Rebuilding the spacecraft structures launcher to be more reliable, repeatable, and sturdy. This task would include constructing the launching device as well as a new “rocket”**

* Brainstorm different ways of simulating the forces of launch
* CAD a design
* Manufacture and test a sub scale
* Manufacture the full scale

**Option 3:**

**Find a way to mass produce our alka seltzer film canister rocket parts for large events like Discovery Days to get more donations.**  


**Option 4:**

**Work with media on increasing awareness of our club on campus and abroad.**
